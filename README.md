# Drag-n-Drop
The website "Mega Drag & Drop" allows users to upload and manage files using a drag-and-drop interface. It features a simple and user-friendly design for uploading files, showing progress, and listing uploaded files with options to download or delete them. 
The site likely uses modern front-end technologies like React and a Firestore as back-end for handling file storage.
